I'm an aspiring self-taught developer currently learning the ropes of web development and app building. So far, I’ve built a Discord bot and I’m diving deeper into tools like Python, JavaScript/TypeScript (MERN, Svelte, etc.), and C# with Unity and Godot. I’m also into creative tech—editing videos in DaVinci Resolve and working with Photoshop for photography and digital design. My goal is to blend creativity with code to build immersive experiences across web, games, and beyond.
